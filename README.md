# 🚀 Agents at Work: Accelerating & Innovating Business Processes
### NSBE 2026 Workshop Masterclass

Welcome to the **Agents at Work** repository! This session is designed to move you beyond simple prompting and into the world of **Agentic Orchestration**. Here, we transition from using AI as a chatbot to using AI as a "Digital Workforce" that executes complex business workflows.

## 📋 Workshop Overview
In this 60-minute session, we explore the architecture, ethics, and implementation of AI Agents.
* **The Shift:** Moving from rigid automation (RPA/Scripts) to adaptive reasoning.
* **The Tools:** Hands-on with Multi-Agent frameworks (CrewAI) and State-Management (LangGraph).
* **The Goal:** Build a production-ready blueprint for business process innovation.
